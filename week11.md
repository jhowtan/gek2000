##Alan Brinkley, “Prosperity, Depression, and War, 1920-1945” in Eric Foner,  ed  The New American History  (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1997), pp. 133-151

Alan Brinkley’s treatment of the years 1920-1945 is a survey of how historians have analyzed this important period.

a. Summarize what different historians have said about the 25 years.
b. Why have the interpretations changed and evolved since the 1950s?

*25 Years: Progressive Era / Jazz Age / Great Depression / New Deal*

## PATTERNS OF HISTORICAL EXPLANATION (HISTORIOGRAPHY)

**Schlesinger**: American history as a cyclical pattern ("a continuing shift in national involvement, between public purpose and private interest")

* Predictability of a cyclical pattern is to cope with the unpredictability of the rise and fall.
* People find difficulty in coping with change (esp with sudden changes)
* Historians look at patterns to cope with the chaos.
* cyclical patterns provide a sense of order to make sense of all the 'disorder'

**Organizational Synthesis**: (Challenged Schlesinger's notion of 'cycles') Momentary fluc- tuations m the political and cultural climate (such as the contrast tween the stagnant" politics of the 1920s and the "progressive" nature of the New Deal) have seemed less important to them than the broad adaptations imposed on society by the economic and bureaucratic revo- lution.

60s: Focus on the strong relationship between Government and Big Business (Military-Industrial Complex)

* Big is the order of the day - Cold War relationship between the govt and big business.

**Consensus Scholarship**: Consensus scholars tended to discount the importance (and question the value) of conflict, even as they lamented what they considered the harsh and barren nature of the American political tradition; and they emphasized the limits more than the extent of reform.

* What went wrong was more important than what went right. (view of negativity)
* Individuals have less and less control/say over what goes on in the country.
* Historians looking back is free from the restraint of mass consumerism.
* Very critical of the American constitution and big govt because the small guys (citizens) had very little say.

> "Liberal reform had been responsible for an increase in democracy and social
ustice in American life. On the contrary, claimed scholars such as Gab- riel Kolko, Jones Weinstein, and (later) Jeffrey Lustig, the real story of modern America was the decline of genuine democracy"

**BARRY KARL**

>Karl suggests that progress toward national unity has not been the hallmark of modern American development. On the contrary, he claims, twentieth-century society is at least as notable for the degree to which it has failed to nationalize, for the extent to which it has resistedunity, for .the ways in which localism and traditionalism have not only survived, but flourished... Americans fervent commit- ment to the preservation of individual liberties has consistently prevented them from defining themselves clearly as a nation.

* USA is not a nation at least for that period
* Individuals (SELF) comes above everyone else (community)
* Bill of Rights held on so strongly that it prevents people from seeing the greater good out there
* Protects self-interest over national good

##CULTURAL CONFLICT

> All were examples of "symbolic" or "status" politics, which appealed not to the middle class in general but to troubled, usually marginal people who expressed their inchoate anxieties in largely symbolic terms — through a nostalgic **call for restoration of a "golden" past** or through an embittered **attack on symbolic "scapegoats."**

* Historians not satisfied with the current status quo
* Thus seek answers or lessons to draw from the past.

>  The new, bureaucratic order, they argue, was threatening not just to iso- lated, provincial people but to everyone whose livelihood or values
depended on the survival of **localistic, decentralized institutions**

* example given: KKK (example of extremism - violent organisation)
* "combatting the moral laxness of modern life".
* KKK result of politics? No; Religion and culture.
* Viewing how American history changes not just due to political forces but also due to religious and cultural forces.
* Historians tend to look at history from a political perspective.


> Stuart Ewen, and Roland Marchand— have produced a broad .(and
highly diverse) literature emphasizing the ways in which material abun- dance, the pervasiveness of advertising, the homogenization of mass cul-
ture, and the increasing availability of consumer goods have defined the nation's social and political val

* Bottom up perspective.
* Spending power (consumerism) - cause consumer changes

## NEW ERA

> The political history of the intemar years has undergone substantial re- vision as well, often as a result of the same impulses that have reshaped interpretations of social and cultural phenomena.


## NEW DEAL

* every time historians examine the new deal they will always arrive back at the same rhetoric.
* New Deal represented a very good part of history. (did not want to ruin the narrative)
* How do people feel(mentality/ feelings) about the new deal era looking back: Feel good - a lot of change was done to combat a very bad situation.

**New Deal Revisionist**

>they (Historians) have begun to ask some different questions
about the New Deal, questions that are less concerned with establishing whether it was a good or bad thing than with explaining how it took the form it did, what effects it had, and how it helps illuminate larger pat- terns of political change in the twentieth century.

* FDR is not omnipotent: there were a lot of constraints in forming the New Deal

>Similarly, as James Patterson and others have shown, the clumsy, jerry-built welfare state that emerged from the New Deal (of which the
expensive and inefficient Social Security System remains the center-
piece) was in large part a product of the strong ideological opposition, even among many of the most comjmitted liberals, to an overt system of
government welfare; and as Jill Quadagno has noted, it reflected too the
racist assumptions of much of the political world through its careful ini- - tial exclusion from coverage of those occupations in which African
Americans (and women) were most heavily represented.

> Starting in the 1980s, a new body of scholarship began to identify some previously lightly exarzdned constraints imposed on the New Deal
by the nature of American governmentaland political institutions.

* Historians looking back in History with Happenstance.
* Element of luck - important because it deals with the element of uncertainty.
* Quite common with the Cold War historians.

## No matter how much information you have of the past since sources are vast, how you interpret them are very different. Mentality will usually change due to the circumstances of the present. What was left out in the past they will go back and study. What historians study depends on what they want to find based on existing circumstances.

# Lecture: The Greatest Generation comes home

Greatest Generation: WWII soldiers who came home from the war.

Post WWII events set the precedents for the civil rights movement.

Roosevelt - 'New Deal' taken over by Harry S Truman (continue Roosevelt's legacy) became 'Fair Deal'. Democratic Party presidents have names attached to their policies - refer to social, cultural, economic welfare reforms. Obama did not call his medical care any two word labels, but he was trying to continue the FDR legacy.

Dwight Eisenhower (Ike) 1952 - First Republican president to gain office after 5 terms of Democrats. When he ended the war he was in charge of D-day. Came back as a war hero. Both parties wanted to recruit Ike, was a recognised figure that was liked and respected - not difficult for him to get elected President. Up to 1952, Ike never voted in an election (neither Democrat nor Republican). Military officers are supposed to keep their opinions of the political system separate. Military career since young man, never had a civilian career. Military and civilian affairs should be kept separate - conservatively thought that his views should not be expressed even when casting votes. Republicans were successful in recruiting him because of Ike's Republican (conservative) attitude.

Affluent society - American society after the war; 1945-65 high water point of American economics. Middle class grew trememndously. Economy was responsible for half of the world's economic output. Greatest income *equality* was seen during this period. Most people could consume at the same level as their neighbours. However, at least 10% of the population was poorer (discriminated against - Blacks).

## Observations

**Great material prosperity in the 1950s** - prosperity was shared unlike in the Gilded Age where wealth flowed to the top 5% of the population.

Also the **beginning of the Cold War** - feelings of insecurity and anxiety. Major turning point for America in its foreign policy. Europe has been defeated after the WWII, America got to set its own terms of engagement on the world.

1950s - **Period of Consensus and Conformity** (conservative period)

**Anxiety over Soviet intentions **- air raid shelter in homes (NY); would not have allowed someone to survive a nuclear war, people built blueprints anyway. Schoolchildren of that period had to undergo the practice of hiding under desks (fright).

**Activist role of president** - 'most powerful man in the world' attached to the office and presidency of the US. Device was carried around that would signal to start sending nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union.

**Size and role of the federal government became permanent due to FDR reforms** - FDR introduced Social Security Numbers - social welfare (pension scheme) for Americans during retirement. Requires a permanent bureaucracy that would take care of these things.

**Permanent standing armed forces** - permanent military force (no more massive demobilization) One reason was due to the threat of the Soviets, but secondly because it was now a world superpower. Heavily dependent on modern technology.
"With this great dependence on technology for the military" --> "military industrial complex" (Eisenhower) : American military has become so dependent on the military contractors that it is an unhealthy relationship which would be undesirable for US to go into the future. Military will keep commissioning more and more expensive equipment, economy will suffer due to the military spending over the consumer spending. 60-70% of US spending is accounted for by the individual. If military spending takes up too much of the economy, then the consumer spending will fall - dangerous.

## Prosperity

**1945 - mid 60s: Great economic boom** - creation of a large middle class (GI Bill of Rights); Baby Boom (generation that was born after the war), demographic leap after the war - 1929 up to 1945: negative economic conditions meant that people could not afford that many kids; American males were fighting the war so fewer babies were born. Birth control pill was invented in the 1960s - this is where the Baby Boom generation ended. At every stage of the Baby Boom Generation's life - they drive all the trends (baby stage - consumption of milk, toys; teenagers - clothes etc. old - medicine, retirement homes) Numbers are greater than any other generation. Economic boom was also fuelled by defense spending.

**3 great cornerstones of spending in America** (great indicator of how well US economy is doing - growth and consumption):

* Housing - durables
* Automobiles
* Military

**Part of the boom:**

* Creation of suburbs & bedroom communities
* Highway construction & integration of South into national economy
* TV in the 1950s & other leisure activities

**Role of women:**

Back to the home:

1. Single income sufficient,
2.  Bedroom communities – father, little role in upbringing of kids
