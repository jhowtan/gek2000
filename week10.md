**‘The Good War’** - ideological 'good' guys, morally superior; fighting against the tyranny of the Nazis; not found evidences of US troops committing atrocities on civilian population (as compared to Korea and Vietnam). Troops from this war are venerated as the 'Greatest Generation' (popularized only in the last 20 years).

## Observations

1920s – US, disillusioned with outcome of WWI, turn inwards – decade of excess, self-involvement & materialism – trend of isolationism  BUT Dominance & interference in the Western Hemisphere – ‘banana republics’

Banana Republics (term used by media) - certain islands/colonies in the West Indies; produced bananas as a main economic activity for the domestic American market. Political stability in these regions led to American interference (closer neighbours)

*Isolationism* - word is too strong, implies that US closed doors; US paid less attention to external affairs (Asia and Europe)

International instrument of American foreign policy:

* conferences, moralistic statements, non-recognition of undesirable regimes,
    - *Non-recognition* - when Soviet Union took over the Russian empire, US did not recognise the regime, did not extend diplomatic relations to Soviets until FDR.
* expansion of overseas economic interests

Differences between Wilson’s & Roosevelt’s ‘neutrality’ - R pointed out neutrality was not a matter of atttitude (proclamations), a matter of policies and actions taken. R chose to acknowledge that a proclamation is insufficient. US will be judged by what it did over what it said.

* Germany’s dissatisfaction with Treaty of Versailles - punitive
    - Germany had territories taken away
    - Payment of war reparations
    - Burdened the German economy
    - Attempts at disarmament (Germany not allowed to have a military force)
* 1929 Crash
    – defaulted on War debt
    - Chain effect: Economic hardships compounded; listened to more radical parties who convinced the desperate to overthrow existing regimes
    - Gave rise to Authoritarian regimes in Europe and Asia
        - rise of Nazism & Japanese militarism (idea of economic sphere of influence)
    - 1933 Hitler:
        + Withdrawal of Germany from League of Nations, and began rearmament
* 1936 Germany reoccupation of Rhineland
    - Indication that Europe was going to plunge into war again
    - Political climate suggests that America is shirking its responsibliities

## Aggression in Asia

* 1931 – Manchurian Incident (Japan occupies Manchuria)
    - Withdrawal of Japan from League of Nations in 1933
    - Turned back on Treaty of Versailles (reject the settlements of WWI)
* 1937 – Sino-Japanese war
    - 1939 (beginning of the WWII only applies to Europe)
    - Most people acknowledged that the Second World War started in 1937
* Increasing US-Japanese friction over Japan’s expansion
    - Europeans were too busy with Nazism to bother with SEA;
    - France and Britain has been major players in South East Asia (4 major colonies - Britain; 3 major colonies - France)
    - America paid the most attention on the Japanese activity in Asia

## American Isolationism

* American attention focused on own economic difficulties
    - '34 '35 - clear that War was going to break out in Europe again
    - Because of economic interests, US got into WWI
* Isolationism strong – majority wanted to stay out of Europe’s problems
* Idea that American business interests had “dragged” US into WWI – **Nye Committee, Senate**, 1934-36 – ‘merchants of death’ – munitions makers (next tutorial)

## Appeasement

* Munich 1938 - to buy off (an aggressor) by concessions usually at the sacrifice of principles
    - Hitler had lied to Neville Chamberlain and was going to roll on Europe
    - Britain and France anxious to avoid war and allowed Hitler on his expansionism
    - 'Appeasement' - weak nations should not be overtaken by strong nations who wish to control their lands (Principle of Sovereignty of Nations)
* Britain & France acquiesce in the breaking up of Czechoslovakia - 1938
* 1939 Nazi-Soviet Pact
* Invasion of Poland (Germany got bolder after Czechoslovakia)
    – Britain & France declares war
* 1940 – France falls; Britain fights alone: bombing raids on major British cities (Blitz of Britain)
* Sept 1940: Tripartite Pact, Germany, Italy & Japan; “3 bandit nations” (FDR) - didn't want the Germans to win, but he has not taken much action on the situation
* 1941 – Germany attacks Soviet Union (despite the pact, Germany was not loyal)

## US Neutrality (and Non-neutrality)
* Series of Neutrality Acts
* 1935 Neutrality Act – prohibited arms shipment to all belligerents
    - some of the passengers travelled on European ships (Lucitania)
    - senators wanted to avoid repeating the same tragedies of WWI
    - took FDR for his words; actions > words
* 1935 – building of US warships – biggest peacetime defense budget up to that point
* 1936 – 2nd Neutrality Act: prohibited loans to belligerents (Britain, France)
* 1937 – 3rd Neutrality Act: no loans, ‘cash-and-carry’ principle of non-military goods; Americans cannot travel on ships of belligerents (don't expect the US Govt to stand up for your behalf)
* 1937 – FDR’s famous ‘quarantine’ speech (next tutorial)
* 35-37: Acknowledged that war was going to happen, and set the precedents for US involvement in the War.
* 1938 funds for air force
* 1939 4th Neutrality Act – ‘cash-and-carry’ extended to military goods
* Late 1930s – secret deals to sell military equipment to France & China (‘methods short of war’)
    - Question FDR's neutrality?
* 1940 – sale of old surplus military equipment to Britain & France
* Mid 1940 – fall of France
* 1940 – destroyer for bases deal with Britain
    – 50 destroyers for control of British bases in Canada & Caribbean (Americas)
    - America wasn't at war, US didn't need the British bases for protection
    - **‘arsenal of democracy’** - others doing the fighting, US supply weapons
    - Quid pro quo; Britain could not pay for it, FDR secretly supporting Britain. Actions were not neutral.
* 1940 – 1st peacetime draft
* FDR Fireside chat – 19 to 30. from Dec 1941 to mid 1944 all about the War
    - made sure that people had maps as he gave his speech
    - used the media to educate the people on what was going on
* **‘Atlantic Charter’** – Aug 1941 meeting with Winston Churchill
    - idea of collective security & other post-war arrangements
    - made it clear to Britain that decolonization is the penance for US' help
* 1941 – “Lend-Lease”
    – Britain broke
    – ‘fire hose’ analogy: transfer of weapons to Britain and China; weapons are expendable, no possiblity of return
    - transfer of a considerable amount of food (not returnable)
    - Eventually extended to Russia (Russians did not know that America was trying to feed them - angered US)
* 1941, July – Japan enters Indo-China (SE Asia)
    - Japan signed a deal with the puppet regime in France for right of passage through Vietnam (Indo-China)
    -  US oil exports embargo – freeze Japanese assets
    -  Relationship deteriorates (Japan: US is intent on stopping us)

## Pearl Harbour + Invasion of Phillippines

* 'Back door to War'
    - Front door: Atlantic
    - Back door: Pacific
    - With all the neutrality and nye committee expecting the war to come from Europe, they viewed it as the Front Door
* Asian War is known as the Pacific Front; Eastern Front: War with Germany and Russia; Western Front: Germany and Britain
* 1941 Dec - Declaration of War; Full mobilisation of US

## Homefront

* **Mobilization of resources**
    - Industrial production for the war effort pulls the US out of the Depression (Deficit Spending)
    - Military-Industrial Complex (Eisenhower) - strong govt-business ties
* **Movement of people**
    – blacks, others to both coasts
    - Industry of manufacturing of weapons at both coasts (atlantic/pacfic)
* **The Domestic Economy**
    * Civilians are affected
        1.  great numbers of women do jobs previously held by men (women taking over work in heavy industries)
            - 'Rosie the Riveter' - "We Can Do It!" (Cultural Icon)
        2.  Rationing affects domestic consumption
            - The technological war – science & the bomb (Manhattan Project)
            - Agriculture as big business
                + Rationing
                + Victory Garden - planting veg and fruit in backyard (not a lot of impact); more of a psychological impact that suggests they can contribute to the warfront
            - Selling the war at home – Propaganda & Hollywood

* Internment of Japanese (US Citizens)
    – over 100,000 from 1942
    – ‘relocation centres' – think 'concentration camps' (but ARE NOT)
    - Miscarriage of Justice (infringement of Civil Liberties) - not ratified until Bill Clinton / Jimmy Carter
* Segregated military
    – Blacks fought but paid less; but opportunities for blacks
    – eg pilots - 1941
* GI Bill – 1944
    – Concern for what will happen post-war
    - educational benefits (college education) after the war if survive
    - College education -> middle class (upgrade of social standing)

## The European War

* Argument over western front – Soviet suspicion
    - "When are you going to invade France and roll back the German rule" - Normandy Invasion had to be provisioned for
    - Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting; Stalin's disdain for Allied side because of Allied discimination towards their Communist ideology
* Yalta arrangement – Argument that Roosevelt gave too much away to Soviets (faulty?)
    - Embolden the Soviets, led the antagonism between the two countries
* Tendency to treat WWII as prelude to Cold War?

## Manhattan Project

* Truman’s decision (rationale)
    - "End war soon & bring the ‘boys’ home"
    - Prevent large number of deaths (should war continue to be fought)
    - Racist?
        + By the time Truman found out about the bomb, the war on the European front has already been abated
        + Not dropped on Germany but on Nagasaki/Hiroshima
    - Demonstrate American power to Soviets?
        + Argument that US wanted to dominate the post-war arena
        + Ideological interests (prelude to Cold War)

## Results of WWII

* **Radical change in role of US** – recognition that great power conferred responsibility – assumed leadership & global role
* Determined not to repeat mistakes of WWI – League of Nations & Versailles – US to be fully involved – 1943 – charter of UN discussed – idea of Big 4/5
* US biggest military & economic power – other developed countries devastated by war
    - accounted for half of the world's output at that point in time
* Permanent shift of balance of power to the US (from Europe)
    - Economies were hit in Europe and countries had to recover
* Presidency grew at expense of other branches of govt
    – beginning of Imperial Presidency?
    – technology?
        + has overtaken the constitution; i.e. declaration of war - power used to lie with the senate. With the nukes in arsenal, the power shifted to the Executive (President)
* **Big govt, big business, big military, big agriculture**
