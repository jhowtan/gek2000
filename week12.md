Use the bill of rights to examine the sources

In order of descending neutrality: (tone has changed from 1935 - 1942)

## Gerald P. Nye (Causes of War)

* against war
* america's involvement in wwi was economic in nature (for money)
* bad because it violates neutrality

>Now, we must not forget that this enormous trade required financing also on an enormous scale. Our State Department at the outset of the war announced that "in the judgment of this Government loans by American bankers to any foreign nation which is at war are inconsistent with the true spirit of neutrality."

* the big problem with neutrality during wwi was basically if the state didn't want to get involved, did not extend its laws to the private sector and banks were free to lend money.

>From the early days of the war the State Department did not object to bank credits bein extended to belli erents as distin uished from loans... America's bankers ceaseddistinguishing between credits and loans and the Government was helpless to prevent this.

* Neutrality only changed in 1939, more enforced but only managed to get it to be a cash and carry. 1939 was already WWII in Europe (Poland invasion)
* America didn't enter the war, will provide material aid but only on a cash and carry basis
* 1941 Lend-lease act right in the midst of WWII - completely different attitudes and tones

## FDR (Chautauqua)

* tone: no urgency on FDR's part to enter the war.

>They would tell you — and, unfortunately, their views would get wide publicity — that __if they could produce and ship this and that and the other article to belligerent nations the unemployed of America would all find work__, They would tell you that if they could extend credit to warring nations that credit would be used in the United States to build homes and factories and pay our debts. They would tell you that America once more would capture the trade of the world.

* already knew that by 1936 for america to get out of depression was to go into war spending but he did not get america into the war.

>If we face the choice of profits or peace, the Nation will answer- must answer — "we choose peace."

* very determined to avoid the war.
* 1936 in Europe war situation was not very urgent; early stage of tripartite act.
* anything that does not involve britain or france directly, america would otherwise have not involved herself in matters of war.

## FDR (Quarantine)

* general view: still inclined to avoid war
* but: realised that the danger is encroaching - 1937 marco polo bridge incident. Asia started WWII even earlier (as some historians may argue)
* may not be possible to maintain isolationist and neutral attitudes

>I am compelled and you are compelled, nevertheless, to look ahead. eace the freedom and the securit of ninet ercent of theo ulation
of t worldis bein 'eoardizedbtheremainintenercentwhoare threatemn a breakdown of aii international order and iaw.

* tripartite act has already been established by this time.
* touches on things that go beyond military affairs:

>It is true that they involve definite violations of agreements, and especially of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Briand-Kellogg Pact and the Nine Power Treaty. But the also involve problems of world economy, world security and world humanity.

* no danger for americans but it was not possible at that time to traverse the atlantic much less the pacific. (america was relatively safe)

>When an epidemic of physical disease starts to spread, the community
approves and joins in a quarantine of the patients in order to protect the health of the community against the spread of the disease.

* analogy was very apt: testing the political waters early - persuade the congress to approve the war making efforts (only congress can declare war)

## FDR (Arsenal of Democracy)

* WWII has already started, France would fall in 4 months.
* FDR tone: complete militarisation of america.

>To survive in such a world, we would have to convert ourselves permanently into a militaristic power on the basis of war economy

* need to know how to react in wartime. such drills call for the militarisation of the country.

>We must be the great arsenal of democracy, Forusthisisanemergency
as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.

* america has not entered the war at this point yet. (Pearl Harbor)

## Charles A Beard (Lend-lease 1941)

* thinly veiled attempts at helping britain and france by now
* lend-lease is pointless because they are just "buying peace"
* if i want to help, i should help fully; if i don't want then I shouldn't even do lend-lease at all.
* If we lend them money, the natural next step is to lend them American Soldiers.
* What good will it do to help if it actually does not guarantee the success/victory of British - Britain has not completely crumbled because they are separated by the English channel from the European hinterlands.
* Rather than spend money on others, should spend money to consolidate all the resources to protect American soil.
* D-day victory secured for Europe by the Americans.

## FDR's War Message

* Bypass the congress to wage war.
* Article 1 of the Constitution talks about congress and house of representatives; only congress has the power to declare war, and allocate budget for military. All the military administration is handled by the congress.
* Article 2 talks about executive (presidency); President's role after declaration of war is to command the army.
* This was a great leap in the constitution - groundbreaking speech that not only goes by the war rhetoric but also lets FDR declare war as a unilateral decision which he was not allowed/supposed to.

>I believe I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us again.

# Lecture

1960s - Fracturing of society over foreign policy and civil rights movement

Great Society - 1. Legislature to give more civil rights. 2. Economic reform movement.

'War on Poverty' - helping disadvantaged to gain economic and social rights.

1961: No one could predict what would happen

- JFK: charismatic young president
- Described in common rhetoric: idealism, optimism, confidence

JFK didn't achieve a lot, historians don't rank him very high, yet American people would put him as part of the top 10 presidents. Youngest president to be elected. Replaced the oldest president to be elected (Ike) - represented youth and vigor to replace a tired old man.

End of 1960s: Too much has changed.

- distrust of the government (govt was not honest because it lied to the young people) can't trust anybody above 30.
- older generation referred to as the establishment (youths were distrustful of them)
- Liberals, vietnam conflict, conservatives, feminist and civil rights movement
- Interest group politics - not just labour, blacks, women anymore.
- Belief that government leaders and politicians are liars; there was still a basic trust/bond between the people and the state back in the 60s.
- Today, however, if politicians are caught in a lie, they do not get reelected.
- The media age - public relations has become very important. Media investigates deeply. e.g. Jimmy Carter claimed to believe in Public Education and sent his kids to Public schools; yet Clintons kids did not.
- Public and private lives of the politicians are intertwined (increased scrutiny)
- Fundamental questioning of American superior values, authority (don't trust anyone over 30)
- The American Dream came into question: represents the aspiration of Americans to have a better life for themselves and their children.

1960s: Decade of revolution, dissent and protest

1. Civil Rights (black) Movement
2. Anti-Vietnam Protest
3. Feminism (gender)

- Personnel from one movement also sometimes active in others
- Techniques used in one movement borrowed by other movements, e.g. non-violence, passive resistance, sit-ins, etc
- Mostly young - (Baby Boom kids in late teens or early 20s) - youth revolts in other parts of world, e.g. China, France, UK – anti-authoritarian rebellion
    - demographics driving history: generational.

1961: America does not want to see discrimination against blacks anymore.

##Civil Rights Movement

- 1954 (important year) 
      - Brown vs Board of Education – separate education ‘inherently unequal’ (since 1896 Plessy vs Ferguson)
      - difference in funding received for the separate schools because of the difference in property tax paid by the poorer neighborhoods. 
      - Eisenhower less committed to integration
      - not federal role, state role
- August 1955 – Emmett Till
- 1955 Montgomery Bus boycott- Rosa Parks - December

###Emmett Till

>"Your fathers will turn over in their graves if [Milam and Bryant are found guilty] & I'm sure that every last Anglo-Saxon one of you has the courage to free these men in the face of that [outside] pressure."

Trial was over and it was found that they are innocent; however, Milam and Bryant confessed to the killing the following year (but have already got away with murder)

The judge made the trial about race. Widespread media coverage.

>“2 months ago I had a nice apartment in Chicago…. I had a son. When something happened to the Negroes in the South I said, `That's their business, not mine.' Now I know how wrong. I was. The murder of my son has shown me that what happens to any of us, anywhere in the world, had better be the business of us all”

This incident made the Blacks very aware of the lynching that was still happening in the south.

###Rosa Parks

Four months later after the Emmett Till incident. 

Blacks took a 381 day bus boycott in Montgomery Alabama. Blacks were the majority taking the bus (poor), the bus companies suffered financially. Blacks were civil servants that were going to be late, and the White economy would be affected.

Buses were segregated, refused to move to the back of the bus because she was reminded (or was thinking of Emmett Till).

"Mother of the Civil Rights Movement" - there were others in the South who refused to give up their seats. But Rosa Parks' case was the figurehead that was picked - was a good case for publicity of the Civil Rights Movement (others did not have the same public image as her)

###1957 Little Rock, Arkansas

Challenge to integration of 9 black children – Eisenhower forced to federalise Arkansas National Guard, sent paratroopers to escort the teenagers to school – in retaliation, public schools closed down in 1958, 1959

White people refused to admit Black people into the school. Parents, authorities, and even the teenagers were against the idea of integration. (e.g. Elizabeth eckford front – hazel bryan)

###1957 Civil Rights Act

- Civil Rights Act 1957- ineffective,
- Negros, niggers, colored, Black Americans, African-Americans
- Civil rights dependent on President & prestige of his Office (how far he is willing to enforce civil rights)
- Not dependent on personal feelings, but political orientation – Democrats or Republicans (close relationship of black votes with Democrat Party)

### Martin Luther King

Middle class blacks for more than one generated.

Martin Luther King, Christian minister – Gandhi - peaceful, non-violent protest – lunch counter sit-ins etc, 1960, Greensboro, N Carolina, 4 students

- techniques effective - civil disobedience – disobey law & accept consequences if believe law is immoral (can protest by non-resistance, can only break rules that are immoral)

e.g. 1960 Greensboro NC – 4 students – sit-ins

- JFK’s timidity – wafer-thin margin at winning presidential elections
        - promised to do something but he won by very few votes.
        - Kennedy was rather timid in pushing his own agenda
        - Blacks realized that and took things into their own hands
- Blacks initiated own civil rights movement  - 3 organisations:
- SCLC, CORE, SNCC – de-segregate buses, lunch counters, libraries, & encouraging registration to vote
- TV aided the Civil Rights movement: images were broadcasted on national TV / news
        -  Images of children being attacked by fire hose & police dogs in Birmingham, Alabama, May 1963 
        - MLK March on Washington, Aug 1963, ‘I have a dream’ speech at Lincoln Memorial tide turning (prominent whites were present at the speech)

### Deconstructing the MLK Speech - We Shall Overcome

MLK had a draft of the speech that he was going to give. And when he gave the speech there was overwhelming response.

Pressure was on Kennedy. MLK chose Washington DC because there would be the most publicity.

Kennedy’s assassination & civil rights – LBJ campaigned for legislation by invoking JFK’s memory – ‘Great Society’

Kennedy failed to pass any civil rights legislation before the assassination.

LBJ unlikely liberal president – southern (texas) – perceived as more conservative than JFK – yet achieved more for civil rights

LBJ campaigned for civil rights, and passed the civil rights legislation in Kennedy's memory. 

LBJ determined to finish FDR’s liberal agenda – through legislation, federal role in assisting the under-privileged of society – government as ‘compensatory state’

We shall overcome speech – 15 march 1965, one week after selma

### 2 pronged approach to helping blacks

1. "War on Poverty"
        - Great Society legislation aimed at providing federal assistance in education, Medicare, housing etc – aimed at all poor & disadvantaged
        - Civil Rights Act (1964, 65, 68) - four pieces: 
            - 1964 - Civil Rights Act:- outlawed discrimination on basis of race, color, religion, sex etc 
            - 1964 – 24th Amendment – outlawed poll tax in federal elections
            - 1965 – Voting Rights Act  - federal supervision of voter registration – “we shall overcome” speech, March 1965
        - 1968 – Civil Rights Act ban racial discrimination in housing 
3. "Affirmative Action"
        - To correct past societal discrimination
        - Minorities, women & other disadvantaged groups given special consideration in employment, education & contracting decisions
        - Mandated especially where federal funding is received
        - Very few organizations that don't take public funding: as long as public funding is received, no discrimination is allowed.
        - Private clubs and organizations discriminated against races.

Judicial liberalism & protection – Miranda (1966) & other legal safeguards 

Not a single word on constitution has changed with regards to the personal rights for arrests. Constitution was flexible enough to expand and safeguard the interests of ordinary citizens.

Miranda – fifth amendment – right to silence and against self-incrimination

1964-68, racial riots, hundreds
        - blacks impatient – reforms long overdue, voting rights benefited mainly Southern blacks – 
        - northern blacks still suffered economic inequality – 
        - LBJ (whites) frustrated & angry that blacks not more grateful – reversal of previous circumstances – black fear of whites (lynching) has now turned into whites avoiding black dominant neighborhoods

Blacks felt entitled to their own rights, and all the changes that should have been in effect.

**Increased Radicalization of Black Movement:**

Leaders who, unlike King, did not advocate nonviolence – e.g. Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, Black Panthers (militant & revolutionary)

Convinced that whites would only yield to stronger, violent tactics, not non-violence.

Blacks started rejecting Christianity because Christianity is the religion of the white people that used Christianity to suppress Blacks. Majority of American Muslims are not from the middle east, but are black muslims (radical muslims). Nation of Islam (1930s)

King disagreed with Vietnam policy of LBJ – by 1967, one of the supporters of anti-Vietnam protests

Law enforcement was not necessarily on the side of the blacks. (Birmingham: dogs unleashed on black protestors; Selma-march65 –beatings)

1976 LBJ:

> “I knew from the start that I was bound to be crucified either way I moved. If I left the woman I really loved—the Great Society—in order to get involved with that bitch of a war on the other side of the world, then I would lose everything at home. All my programs. All my hopes to feed the hungry and shelter the homeless. All my dreams to provide education and medical care to the browns & the blacks and the lame and the poor. But if I left that war & let the Communists take over South Vietnam, then I would be seen as a coward & my nation would be seen as an appeaser & we would find it impossible to accomplish anything for anybody anywhere”

One of the reasons why American economy never quite recovered back to the state of the 1950s was because of the Vietname war.

### Anti-War Movement

1964 - Berkeley & the anti-war movement – students’ protest against racism & Vietnam policy ignited retaliation from University authorities

Campus demonstrations spread to rest of the US – mostly in better Universities – partly motivated by their own self interest – no desire to die in Vietnam

Protests were the most violent in the Ivy Leagues. Protests happen in the Spring and Summer - served the needs of the students.

In better colleges: Draft exemptions for college students, health problems & certain other categories – Selective Service

Draft dodging to Canada, Sweden etc (e.g. Sylvester Stallone)

Protests against universities for doing military research – part of ‘military-industrial-academic nexus’

Vietnam war veterans (John Kerry) returned and protested against the war.

### Hippie Movement

"Turn on, tune in, drop out"

- Not all protests violent – era of flower children & hippies
- Counter-culture values – question pursuit of materialism & financial success, the American Dream – drop out - indulgence in drugs & sex 
- Rock music, protests & alternative life-style
- ‘make love, not war’

Revert to a simpler life, indulge in drugs and sex and to seek alternative lifestyles.

### 1968

Tet Offensive - urban uprising of northern vietnamese people against the American occupants in Vietnam

LBJ was hugely unpopular due to the Vietnam War, decided to withdraw from the presidential race.

MLK and Robert Kennedy were assassinated (both were young in their 30s,40s when they died)

Riots broke out as a result of the assassinations

Chicago riots – Aug, 1968 – Democratic convention to choose presidential candidate – disintegration into violence & chaos – police riot – beating anti-war protesters & demonstrators

Conflicts between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boomer generation - angry with the overprivileged kids.

Yippies (youth independent party) ran ‘Pigasus’ as a presidential candidate to show their contempt for the system.

Derogatory term of 'pigs' used for Police and the System.

### Feminist Movement

- Define women by their relationships and not by what they do for a living 
- 1960 – birth control pill introduced 
- 1963 – influential book – Betty Friedan’s Feminine Mystique – women dissatisfied with unequal status – consciousness raising - even in peace & protest movement – secondary roles, not leaders, support – errands, typing etc
- Economic disparity in job opportunities & income

Glass ceilings for women careers; treated differently even though in leadership positions.

- Feminism – ‘bra burning’ & ‘Consciousness Raising’
- Formation of NOW (National Organization for Women) – 1966
- 1972 – Equal Rights Amendment – not passed – 3 states short of ¾ majority of states – Congress passed it. – 
- 1973 – **Roe vs Wade** – poor couldn't get abortion because abortion was a crime and they couldn't get out of the country to abort. After Roe-Wade, abortion no longer a crime
    - christian values against abortion (conservatives): abortion issue will tear the south apart. 

### Other sexual revolutions

- Co-habitation before marriage
- Gay Liberation
- Bisexuality etc.

## Conclusion

'Great Society' was the last period of liberal reforms.

- the involvement of the Federal govt in programs to address problem of poverty & past inequality in treatment & opportunities
- subsequent reforms have been incremental & piecemeal 
- Economic justice as aspect of political rights:
        - Equality of access to opportunity (correction of past injustices) NOT
        - Equality of outcome
- Presidents elected since have not been liberal

*Emphasis shifted FROM reforms of laws & institutions relating to access to opportunity & of treatment TO liberal ideas of equality & tolerance in private lifestyle choices, eg premarital sex, gender choice, etc*
