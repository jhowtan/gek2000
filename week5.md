## Tutorial 3

__What characteristics did the frontier society help to create in 19th Century Americans?__

### Talking points

- Positive light of Manifest Destiny (Turner's Thesis)
- Negative light of (any) Contentious Characteristics (e.g. Slavery, violence, colonization of America)

__More likely than not, characteristics were developed/moulded rather than born with due to the need of the time.__

__Violence__ - 'assertiveness' of the Manifest Destiny: strong-willed to expand westwards.

__'Crime not to share'__ - Egalitarianism

__'Settlers' call to arms'__ (291,292) - Ideals of Democracy (strong belief and optimism), bringing people together to go forth on westward expansion.

__Young Married Couple__ (304) - Self-sustenance, Independence  
- no other family (Independence)
- optimistic, self-sufficient: "I can make it on my own"
- community: "no man is an island" e.g. American Church congregation tightly knit.
- community: opposed to individualism (does not mean selfish) - _takes priorities or treasures in personal rights_
- communal attitides / sense of community is very high

__Robert Pullingham__ (325) - tale of outlaw (Re-invention of self)  
- borrowed a lot of money, creditors are after him
- pack bags and left the cities in the east
- also: people reinvent themselves as leaders (foreman) because there were none in the western frontier

__Typical American behaviours are essentially inherited from the Frontier period.__

### Summaries and Points from the Text:

_American Public Discourse (R. Burke)_:

- Surrender of Native-American (Chief Joseph) to American General Howard
- "I will fight no more forever." -- overwhelming sense of defeat, futility of trying to go against the American War Machine.
- Many North Americans dead from the fighting, both young and old.
- those who are alive are suffering from harsh conditions -- cold weather and starvation
- _violence from the Americans?_ - how does America show its military power: __Absolute Devastation__
- Environment is harmed, consumes all natural resource
- brings their trade along with them westwards (industry, lumberjacking)

__Major Problems in the Early Republic__

_Black Hawk Surrenders, 1832_

- Americans driving them away from their lands, causing Natives to wage war
- cf. Westward expansion, Manifest Destiny (god-given rights)
- Criticised American motivations for fighting the Indians (extermination? colonization?)
- Natives out-strategized, outgunned -- creativity/resourcefulness, violence?

_On Western Life_

1839: "Whoever comes into Michigan with nothing will be sure to better his community" -- stereotypical of the myth of heading West - re-invention, independence.

Types of Settlers: 

1. Young, Married couples: content with their "bare loggeries"
2. People who left farms in the East in hopes of acquriing property quickly.
    - gave up much of what they had, but not necessarily to better themselves in the West.
    - women who allegedly suffer the most due to drastic changes in environment/lifestyle.
    - (no choice but to follow their husbands west cf. war)
3. People who are poor, or were unsuccessful economically.

1845: Western Clearing

- subsistence farming, harvesting, winter is coming, etc.
- Established and thriving communities.
- (Self reliance and independence)

__The Speculator's Role on the Frontier__  
Rise of Capitalism, Democracy -> Developing the West's Economy

- Individualism - seeking riches
- Real estate the main form of investment (esp. Western)
- But as with investment, carries risk, such as during depression
- Provided social services to frontier community - egalitarianism, mutual care
- Moneylenders
- Split in attitudes towards non-resident speculators
- Promoted (inadvertently) for the increased expansion westwards for settlers in search for land.
- Speculators helped develop a __local economy__, creating jobs and funneled capital into lower when it most needed it.

__The Transformation of a Rural Community: Commonality & Clues in Sugar Creek__ (324)

- Importance of the community in accustoming new settlers.
- exposed to common dangers and tolls
- development of a reciprocal, barter-like "borrowing system"
- landowners able to make use of growing economy to sell land, creating an increasingly concentration of wealth
- Landlords also began to hire wage labour -> development of a local economy

## Observations

The civil war settled the issue of these 2 basic controversies – both constitutional - the principle of states’ rights

1.  The issue of the right to slavery
2.  The issue of the right of secession

Each state claims its rights to decide what's best for the citizens:

The right to extend slavery to newly settled territories of the West – from 1803 (Louisiana purchase), problem not resolved: ’handled’, postponed, accommodation & compromise. (took the Civil War to resolve this)

Territorial expansion:

- Manifest Destiny
- "just, inevitable & divinely ordained",
- Created dilemma
    - Largesse from God
    - Dilemma: Newly settled territories and states - do we have Slavery?

'Modern War' - scope of the war (__total war__), conditions:

* Total mobilization of resources
* Involving large number of civilian deaths
* Vast destruction of properties
* One of the first widely photographed war (Gettysburg 1863 – union soldiers)
      * War was captured on painting prior to the invention of photography in the 19th century.
      * Changed the perspectives and views people had of the war - how bad it was.

Not about quarreling over the number of slaves, but rather over the principle of slavery. US couldn't resolve any other issues before resolving the issue of slavery.

Number of slaves in new Territories small – about 1% or less

Issue of slavery became single defining problem of 1840s & 1850s

Racism in both N & S - attitude that blacks were inferior to whites was quite prevalent even among the Northerners (Social Darwinism - whites were on top and others just fell into place)

Results of Civil War brought dramatic changes into American society & lives

---

## Compromises

__Missouri Compromise 1820__
(fairly early on, issue not going to go away for 40 years)

- controversy affected newly settled lands of Louisiana Purchase (1803)
- Banned slavery N of 36° 30’;
- Missouri, an exception
    - Because the North and the South wanted to admit Missouri as a state.

__1846-48 Controversy over Texas and Oregon__

- Northwest (above California) - collectively called the Oregon territories.
- British presence in Canada.
- Oregon dispute with British peacefully settled (49th parallel - 1846)
- Oregon and Washington was not heavily populated.

__Texas__

- Mexican territory, settled by slaveholders (to increase revenue)
- American settlers (anglo saxon descent, not spanish) declared independence in 1836.
- Lone Star Republic –  applied for US statehood, rejected (US did not want trouble with Mexico)
- 1844 - Texas border dispute with Mexico
- 1846 - __War with Mexico__ (dragged US into the fight)
- 1848, Treaty gave US new territories, California & Nevada, Arizona – question of slavery in the Southwest (extended the issue almost all the way to the Pacific)
    - California was a territory that spanned across North and South, __cannot have a slave compromise in a single state__.

Debates within Congress - none were passed except for the California compromise:

* 1846 Wilmot (N) Proviso (suggested, not passed)
    * Proposed no slavery in territories acquired from Mexico
    * Fear of ‘Slave Power’
    * Dominance of South in the US Congress
* 1846 Calhoun (S)
    * Slaveholders had constitutional right to take slaves into new territories since new acquisition belong to the US, to all citizens
    * Reversal of 1787 NW Ordinance & Missouri Compromise
* 1847 Cass' idea of “popular sovereignty” (related to the Calhoun compromise)
    * Let settlers of new territories decide for themselves
* 1850 California became state – important to South – (see map – 36° 30’ issue)
    * free state in 1850 Compromise
    * Compromise of 1850 – bought time - evasion
        * Left slavery to be decided by settlers, before statehood – ambiguous language – N & S interpreted differently – timing?
        * Tough new law against fugitive slaves – disliked by N. – harsh penalties against harboring fugitives

---

## Underground Railroad, 1840s-60s

System by which slaves escaped to north helped by northern whites & free blacks – ‘passengers’ & ‘conductors’

* Mythologized – few actually escaped (few thousand only)
* Not organized – spontaneous efforts
* Hardest part in the South (slave traders and kidnapping)
* Role of blacks under-estimated
* Propaganda purpose in both N & S

__1854 – Kansas-Nebraska Act__

- establishment of Nebraska & Kansas territories – left slavery question to settlers
- open to slavery – see map
- negation of 1820 Missouri Compromise

__1854 - Birth of Republican Party – Lincoln’s Party__

- Competition between anti-slave and slave-owning sections to occupy new territories (settled by the majority, send as much people as possible)
- ‘Bleeding Kansas’  (Violence)

__Republican North__ – argument of “Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men”
South, dependent on slave labor – no industry, traditional etc

__Democrat South__ – argument that whites, rich & poor, enjoyed equality because blacks were enslaved

---

## Road to War

* 1857 – Supreme Court
      * Dred Scott Decision – slave brought into free territory not free, because not citizen
      * Support of Scott - once brought North, free. South argued otherwise.
* 1860 - Emergence of 2 party system
      * Democrats in the South – Republicans in the North
        * idea of “free soil, free labor, free man”
        * split in institutions, e.g. churches – Southern Baptist, Southern Methodist, etc

South considered secession – South Carolina, the first in Dec 1860 – 6 other states followed – Confederate States of America

Declaration of Independence - articles of confederation: implies that the federal government are weaker, states are stronger. South wants the states to have more rights and say.

North: Abe Lincoln
South: Jefferson Davis

## Civil War

War begins – attack on Fort Sumter in S. C. – April 1861

__Strategic miscalculations on both sides:__

-  Lincoln thought South bluffing but cautious
-  South – not taken seriously by the north – show of strength necessary
-  Both expected short war
-  North had overwhelming advantage in resources, men, industry, diversified economy & stronger central government – had a navy: planned naval blockage

__Implications:__

* Misunderstood each other despite living in the same country for 90 years.
* North had a larger population - only 25% of the population need to be fought by the whites in the North.

South – weak central govt – defensive strategy

__Lincoln & Emancipation Proclamation 1863__ – emancipation of all slaves – Aug 1862, (p 385, 9th edition) __preservation of Union, paramount priority__

1. Effect on South
2. Not everyone in N strongly anti-slavery - Abe was very unpopular in the North.
3. Not all white Southerners were slaveholders – were poor whites prepared to die for wealthy whites?

__Lincoln, 1862:__

        “I would save the Union. If I could save the Union without
        freeing any slave I would do it, & if I could save it by
        freeing all the slaves I would do it; & if I could save it
        by freeing some & leaving others alone I would also do that.
        What I do about slavery, & the colored race,
        I do because I believe it helps to save the Union”

Lincoln favored gradual emancipation – compensation & perhaps colonization of blacks in central America? (colonization of those places)

1. 1863 blacks fight in increasing numbers in Union army – (paid less)
2. Pressure from Radical Republicans – stronger views about South
3. Towards the end, Davis also proposed liberating of black volunteers & their families

Increasing war weariness on both sides & criticism of both Lincoln (ape, baboon) & Davis – suppression of some civil rights (measures taken against civilians that were unconstitutional) & economic hardships

* April 1865 – Appomattox surrender – end of war
* Devastation - especially in the South, most battles were fought in the South.
* Neutrality of Europeans
      * North more successful in diplomacy – hope to prevent European recognition of Confederate
      * Europe, anti-slavery but divided

## Impact of the War

Greater on South than North – most fighting on Southern soils

1. Greater centralisation
2. Beginning of industrialization & urbanisation
3. Role of women
4. Impoverishment of poor whites
5. Unequal sacrifice (substitute notices - pay somebody to fight the war on your behalf)

### Impact on the North

1.  Increasing power of president
2.  Increasing mechanisation of both industry and agriculture
3.  Unification against common enemy
4.  Role of women - family, enterprises

It took 3 amendments to give blacks free, equal legal status:

* 1865 - 13th Amendment – prohibition of slavery – ‘Great Emancipator’
* 1868 - 14th Amendment – citizenship rights for blacks
* 1870 - 15th Amendment – right to vote – not denied due to skin color or race (does not include gender)

Citizenship != Voting rights; white women were citizens but did not have the right to vote. (not until 1920)

* 1m casualties out of population of 31m
* Greatest loss of American lives – greater than Vietnam
    * War deaths + civilian deaths
    * Fought on American soil since Revolutionary War
* Lincoln assassinated – consequences?
* War resolved question of slavery: freedom, not _equality_ for the blacks
* Role & power of Federal govt grew – budget
* Reconstruction – 1865-76/7

## Impact on the South: Reconstruction (11-12 years)

Reconstruction – 2 views on how to deal with South after war:

1.  Reconciliation & re-admission on equal terms
2.  Radical Republicans (Minority)
    * idea of treating South as conquered
    * creation of free white & black society
    * imposed political changes & punitive measures

Johnson, 1865 – Lincoln’s successor

* southern & conservative - policy & attitude of pardon towards former plantation class
* abolition of slavery - but drafting of ‘Black Codes’ limiting black political and economic rights (1865-1868; till 14th Amendment)

Black codes; written into the Southern constitution – low wages, limitation of right to own property, limited the right to travel the state freely (vagrancy laws).

* Radical Republicans unhappy – desired some punishment of Southern slave-owning whites
    * Push through 14th & 15th amendments as conditions for re-entry of Southern states
    * New constitutions for southern states

__Reconstruction Act 1867__

In former slave states - legislature of Southern whites, freed blacks & Northern whites.

Carpetbaggers - pejorative term: _Northern whites who came down South to run for elections._

- Short-lived (Unsuccessful)
- mistakes, corruption, hostility, fiscal problems, inexperience, fundamental imbalance of power
- Some property rights for women

Violence of Ku Klux Klan (KKK) – 1866

- Confederate veterans of the civil war
- Secret white supremacist organisation in South
- Terrorised blacks & their supporters

__Blacks:__

1.  Re-unification of families
2.  Education
3.  Churches
4.  __Sharecropping__
    * 40 Acres + Mule (promise that was not kept)
    * Former slave, not literate, no means of livelihood.
    * Use the land you use to farm.
    * Sharecroppers prevailed 100 years after the civil war (Mississippi) - couldn't get out of debt.

1874 – Democrats regained House of Congress
1876 – Disputed presidential election

Republican Rutherford Hayes elected – deal with southerners?

Reconstruction ended with Rutherford Hayes' election:

- __Reconstruction was not about Blacks' status but more of integrating South into the North.__
- Beginning of black immigration north in bigger numbers
- Reconstruction ends (1877) – a disastrous mistake?
- Reconstruction more an effort to integrate southern states than to resolve status of blacks in the US – racial problem to present

Question of right to secede resolved once & for all – future of states’ rights?

__End of Civil War & Reconstruction__

- Watershed (turning point) – beginning of modern America?
- Industrialization & growth to world power status
- In only 35 years - larger than the 3 largest economies of that time.
