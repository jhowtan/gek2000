Interpreting the Civil War:

_Was the Civil War about ending slavery?_ - _Barbara Fields' Article_

__Ideas/Argument__:

Slaves benefitted during the war as it provided them with some voice in the political system, carrying their demand for freedom from frontlines to government, thereby turning their liberation into a prominent political issue.

Agenda of slaves matched with that of union government's, resulting in the latters' realisation that achieving union without adopting/fighting for universal emancipation is not possible.

## Glossary
__Antebellum__: period before (Civil) War

__Revolution__: necessary conditions - _irreversible, large scale_ change

__Coup D'etat__: Violence is not necessary as opposed to Revolution (blood is spilled)

__Civil War__: largest loss of American lives in its entire history.

_Perspectives_: Blacks vs Whites

_Timeframe_: Antebellum vs Wartime

Slaves benefitted during the war as it provided them with a voice in the political system, carrying their demand for freedom from frontiers to government, thereby turning their liberation into a prominent political issue.

Agenda of slaves matched with that of union government's, resulting in the latter's realization that achieving union w/o adopting/fighting for universal emancipation is not possible.

### Yes

* In order to save union, slavery has to end.
* Wendell Phillips
* Results say so --> those who believed in the emancipation won the war.
* Black people treat the war as a war of emancipation to gain agency (pushed the tide). (Armed forces "Liberation machine")
* Confiscation Act (March 1862) - forbade military personnel from returning fugitive slaves (article of war)
    * abolished slavery in Colombia, and later in all territories
    * Second Confiscation Act passed over Lincoln's objections: declared free all slaves whose owners supported the Rebellion.

### No

* Start war to protect union - priority was union (ending slavery was a means to an end)
* Gives __agency__ to all parties
* Abe Lincoln skirted his entire way through the war to avoid the Slavery issue.
* Abe facilitates the war, he doesn't run the war.
* President, Congress - makes the decisions based on consequences.
* Issue of slavery took on a life of its own - Abe Lincoln followed the waves of the North's victory.

## _Was the Civil War the Second American revolution?_

What were the criteria; Why the criteria says it is or is not a revolution?

__Criteria for Revolution:__

- __Violence__: 620k people died (Civil War) vs 55k (Vietnam War)
- __Social__: Change in social order - No more slavery (but form over function?)
- __Political__: Shift in power dynamics - belong to North now (for the next 100 years)
- __Economical__: Increased Industrialisation (counter-argument: Industrialisation already existed in the Antebellum --> Industrialisation transposed itself to the South as well) Entire US continent saw economical and industrial progress as a whole.
