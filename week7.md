# Week 7

## World War I

First world war occurred in the first half of the 20th century, but the US has already emerged as a Pacific and Atlantic power.

After the Civil War, the US became an economic superpower - it is an accepted fact that Military and Political power comes as an extension of Economic power.

Internally (US) debate: *what kind of role does the US get to play in the world stage?* (what kind of influence should it exert)

**Expansionism** (does not just involve military) - Goods, investments, people and ideas.

Last 2 decades of the 19th Century - High Imperialism of European powers (established vast colonies overseas)

As US emerged as a power, there was an attitude of imperialism towards other countries.

**Foreign policy of US**: weighed down more heavily on Imperialism rather than Expansionism.

US is now a net exporter of industrial, agricultural and financial goods.

**Turner thesis - frontier has now closed.**

Latin-America was seen as the backyard of US.

**Ideology** - system of beliefs that govern the worldview of a society.

**Monroe doctrine** - US was not in a position to enforce the declaration, but it saw itself as a protector of Latin-America; Latin-America saw US involvement as a 'Yankee' interference.

Interference of US in Cuban and Filipino colonies led to a war between Spanish and Americans.

### **Control of Philippines made US a Pacific superpower.**

Before: Agricultural nation; After (1913): Manufactured goods became a greater percentage of exports.

**Paternalism** in US thinking (lesser nations are depicted as women/children - context of that time: women and children are taken care of) - condescending towards Cuba.

**1898 Spanish-American war** – black troops. Segregated armed forces – white and black soldiers did not serve in same units.  The only white person likely to be the officer.  Black troops paid less.  Fight and die in same war.  Usually fighting for ‘democracy’ but did not enjoy democratic rights and equality at home

If they threw off the British as a colonial superpower, why is the US imposing/exerting colonial dominance on others (Philippines)? (Anti-democratic)

*1912-1920 - Woodrow Wilson responsible crafting the ideas for US Foreign Policy*

Wilson's ideas lived on despite his perceived failure in his second presidency term.

Wilson: inflexible, self-righteous; democrat.

**1914 Wilson's Proclamation of Neutrality** - Americans not to take sides (not our war, let the Europeans handle their own issues) yet American sentiments were pro-Allied (prefer British victory) i.e. officially neutral, but british ideas better represented what America stood for - led to White House dilemma: lack of neutrality in the attitudes of Americans.

**Difficult for US to stay fully neutral** - US external links were with Allies (Britain and France) - volume of Economic exchanges were disparate.

**'Freedom of the Seas'** - As a neutral nation, American citizens and ships should not be the target of attacks on either side. (Wilson)

In reality, British (large naval size) - established Naval Blockades; Germans practice submarine warfare to deter against Allied war efforts.

Most important ship that was sank: Lusitania ('Lucy') British ship & goods that carried American passengers (1915); first of a series of ships that led to lost American lives (1915-1916)

Early 1917 - unrestricted submarine warfare (Germans) - challenged US neutrality rights (Wilson)

**Zimmerman telegram** - intercepted by British, sent to Mexico, Germans promised return of Texas to Mexico from US. Understood as an infringement on US sovereignty. Led to Wilson's 'armed neutrality' (more ships lost) - April 1917 declared war 'make the world safe for democracy'.

World War I - 'The War to End All Wars' - Initially supposed to be uninvolved (neutrality), but US was involved in it for last 2 years (1917 as an allied power)

Internal dissent on the involvement in the War:

1. Non-entanglement (Washington) ideas
2. 'Burden of Power' - involvement in European military and politics

Military Preparations: increased taxation, selective service (drafting of 20-30 year old males)

# International consequences

Place of negotiating table after the war - Wilson wanted this because of his ideas on World Politics and Peace.

**Wilsonian Idealism** - reformation of world politics: if you and your neighbor quarrels, other nations have to be collectively responsible for maintaining the world peace. Necessity for a world organization where nations can collectively communicate and resolve quarrels and conflicts to avoid regional repercussions.

Framework of World Peace after WWII: 14 Points - Point 14: League of Nations - collective security, multi-laterism.

British, French - devastated by WWI; US emergence as most powerful nation.

US politics (internal) interfered with foreign policy (external) - treaty is something that the senate has to approve (faced opposition from Republican party). Treaty of Versailles in Paris - Republicans were not consulted. While all other countries in the European league signed the Treaty, Wilson could not do anything about US Senate not passing the treaty.

**League of Nations & Treaty of Versailles** - international law would supersede national law (would be dangerous for powerful nations). League of Nations & collective security (Pt 14, Article 10) charter would obligate US to be involved to the actions and reactions of others - unacceptable to the US Senate.

Doubts over multi-lateralism (US involvement in Europe's affairs)

Wilson was at end of Presidency, but began a campaign - led to Wilson's incapacitation (stroke) - Wilson's wife made decisions on his behalf (strong influence in government)

Post War: Americans turned inwards - tired of involvement in European conflict - led to period of 'isolationism'.

# Domestic Consequences:

Progressivism came to an end.

Beginnings of Big Government (mobilization, organization of resources) - government too big, takes away the power of individuals to make decisions for themselves.

Government-business collaboration - government is not in the business of industrial equipment, contract big companies to manufacture and produce material needs for war efforts. (two big institutions in US, worrisome for individuals)

Growth and enhancement of the power of the presidency - distortion of constitutional arrangements.

Fight for female suffrage: roles of women in war efforts - home, war bonds, nurse services, etc.

*Organizational role in progressive programs (tutorial 5)*

On Suffrage: 15th (1870) to 19th Amendment (1920) - Race, then sex.

**Outcomes of the war efforts**: role of women and blacks in war industry - movement of blacks to northern industrial jobs.

**Suppression of civil liberties** - groups of people who objected to the war were suppressed.

**Civil Liberties & Civil Rights** - used interchangeably elsewhere; however Civil Liberty in US - relationship between you and government; Civil Rights - rights in relation between you and your fellow citizens enjoy.

Dissatisfaction with treatment and conditions (segregation and discrimination in the armed forces) - race riots in the beginning of the war (1917 Houston, Illinois; 1919 Chicago)

German-Americans were targets of abuse (language, books, names)

Labor & other dissenters - dissatisfaction & organization - wartime inflation, ability to strike impinged, laborers who rioted were dismissed as not loyal, not patriotic.

2 Legislations - **Espionage Act 1917**, **Sedition Act 1918** - aimed at language (1st Am. Free Speech right infringed); upheld by Supreme court (criticized subsequently)

**Strikes of 1919 (>3300) fear of communist conspiracy** - May Day mail bombs to prominent Americans, conspirators were not caught.

**1917 Russian Revolution** - First communist (Socialist) government: Fear of Socialism (Reds) - led to Red Scare of 1920; Mitchell Palmer (Attorney General, used Red Scare to increase his own popularity, political ambitions) creation of Bureau of Investigation - deportation/jail for suspects, non-citizens, residents in US - infringement of civil liberties.

**In the second decade of the 20th century - American definition includes only those of European origin:**

Liberty loan poster (war bonds) – Title is “Americans All” – with list of  ‘american’ names – please notice that the names on the list reflect people from all parts of Europe including Italy, Greece, Poland & Northern European countries.  There is even Levy, a Jewish name.  However there are no non-European names.  The implication is that the definition of ‘American’ includes only those of European origin

# Observations

* Undisputed American dominance in world after 1919
* Growth of federal government
* Role of the presidency - at expense of legislature.
* The American war machine - rapid mobilization & US resources by govt - economic resources that US commands such that it could mobilize for war so quickly.
* After Wilson - turning inwards & unilateralism – next lecture

** The necessary exercise of American power - perspective: if America does not exert its dominance, it would be some other country that will bear this responsibility, and that the world would be in a worse state if not for America. (Hegemony)

War as engine of change – constitutional rights, eg the 19th Amendment & domestic developments
