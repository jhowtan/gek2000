### New England

    - Never to return to Britain (different from colonial mentalities)
    - Colonial mentality: Establish outpost, exploit resource and manpower to gain wealth to redirect to the motherland

* Social
    - Permanent settlement: Familial values take priority
    - Close knit relationships (family units start)
* Economic
    - Barter economy (Subsistence farming)
* Religious
    - Church autonomy: deliver persecution - some fled south (Maryland)

    - fled southwards due to religious persecution.
* Economic
    - Trade with the local natives. Subsistence farming.
* Religious
    - Religious tolerance;

## Virginia and Chesapeake
How they came about, why were they there:

* Outpost/Colonial mentality
    - There to get rich
* Social composition
    - Mostly male, larger population of slaves
* Economic
    - Industrial north vs Agricultural south (in proximity to the equator; warmer in the south
    - Plantation crops (cash crops - commodities that can be sold as raw materials) Raw materials to supply the industrial north
    - Industrial Revolution in Britain.
* Religious

    - Deliberately created to decentralize power - not centralized into one authority.
* Separation of Power
    - Power is shared and distributed between the President, legislative body and the judicial system.

__Checks and Balances__

* Legislature is the one that passes the budget.
* Judiciary
    - Law is passed with reference to the Constitution. (constitutional or not?)
    - Judicial system checks both the legislature and the executive.
* Underlying philosophy:
    - Distrust of the concentration of power;
    - Distrust of human nature.

__Roots of Conflict: Seven Years War__

__First modern world war:__

Between british, french and spanish taking place in N America.

__Victory:__ British.

__Balance of power has shifted:__

* Transfers of colonies from power to power.
    - British North + Spanish South.
    - Bering Straits - Russian occupation.

__Post Seven Years War:__

* France has lost majority of power in N America.
* South of British areas became Spanish.
* Britain need not face any hostile foreign power (French)
* Natives could no longer play the powers against each other.

__Shift in Attitudes__

* British soldiers - distance from britain: Growing resentment amongst settlers.
* Expansion westwards of the Appalachian mountains was limited by the British.
* Settlers demands of benefits led to British imposing tax.

__Beyond Navigation Act__ (more measures to raise money to pay off the war):

* Sugar and Currency Acts 1764 (brit demanded payment in silver - real cost)
* Stamp Act 1765 (stamp duty: taxing the literate - printed tax. elites were impacted - idea of taxation with representation) largely resented and eventually repealed because settlers felt unrepresented.
* Townshend Acts 1767 - taxes on tea: boston tea party (tax was not repealed)
Imposed hardship and a lot of resentment from british settlers.

__Resentment of New Taxes:__

* Democracy/Autonomy and Representation or

### Undercurrents of the Intellectual and Political Landscape

__Enlightenment (Age of Reason)__

- Faith in rationality and reason in human affairs
- Cause and Effect:
    - humans can figure out how to work on solutions to the problems;
    - improving their own state of being, society.

__Progressivism__
- things get better if you try to remedy it. (improved through efforts of man through reason)

__Religious__ - Inalienable rights: 'Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness (property)'

_Why property?_

* Elites idea of the right to own things - kings have no right to impose taxes on us.
* Implicit 'contract' between ruler and ruled over natural rights - can be replaced if disrespected.

*Rights and Freedom are linked.*

__Pessimistic basic view:__

* Belief in that things can be improved, yet distrust of centralized power.
* Political power has been feared - rulers would try to oppress
* Therefore, eternal vigilance needed to preserve liberty.

### Revolutionary War

_Boston Committee of Correspondence_

- oppose/protest measures of Townshend Act; gave rise to collective action
- Urged in creating a consensus (philadelphia: cradle of freedom)

_Boston Tea Party 1773:_

- Closed the Boston Harbor by the Boston Governor due to Settlers protest of the Tea monopoly of EIC.
- Threw the tea shipment into the Boston Harbor.
- Boston urged meeting in 1774:
    - First Continental Congress - delegates from 13 states to meet in Philly.

_First battles: Lexington & Concord 1775_

_1st Committee of Correspondence:_
Petition and economic boycott of brit goods - disintegration of brit admin in colonies

* 1776 Declaration of Independence (T Jefferson)
* 1781: British surrendered at Yorktown
* 1783: Treaty of Paris - 13 colonies granted independence (along east coast)
    * Actual treaty of independence - 1783.
    * American belief / point of reference - 1776

__Minority in Rev War: Loyalists (1/5)__
_Half-half distribution of support: Patriots and Neutral parties_

###Reasons for the Loss:
* Military reasons:
    * Americans waged guerrilla warfare against British conventional warfare
    * Less than 5% population in cities (capture of major cities didn't make sense)
    * British belief that overpowering the american settlers will lead to political victory
* Settlers victory due to:
    * British mistakes and attitudes
        * Underestimated Patriots' commitment to independence
        * Former enemies of the british would come to their aid
        * Failure of natives to unite against the patriots
            * Natives were not unified
        * No slave uprising - took the opportunity to run away (55k left); harvest was affected in 1780-81
        * Undemocratic measures were taken against opponents

###Building the Charters of Freedom

__2nd Committee of Correspondence:__

* Drafting of individual states' constitution - limited government is the best govt.
* Prevent tyranny rather than effective exercise of power.

__1777: Articles of Confederation__

* Want a weak central government that cannot impose much taxes
* Impacts:
    * No army. individual state militias - national guard (under the authority of the state governor) Problem of external security.
    * Unable to force the individual states to comply in matters of trade, foreign policy and currency.

__1787: Constitutional Convention - Philadelphia__

* Gave rise to delegates
* Ideas of separation of power & checks and balances

__Problem of Slavery:__

* Contradiction, paradox - ideals of liberty (conflict on human rights and property rights)
* Slavery as it developed in the new world became identified with one race:
    * Black == slave and vice versa.
* (Most people enslave their own kind. only on the N and S American continents were of the African race)

__Representation system in congress:__

* 13 states have senators (2 senators each)
    * regardless of the size of the state.
* House of congress has proportionate representation
    * number of representatives from the state is proportional to the size of the state.
* For purposes of representation (due to Virginia delegates' repeal)
* 3/5s of a white person - voting rights of a black person.
* Universal Suffrage did not come till after the Civil War.

1788: Very difficult to pass the constitution because 2/3s need to sign. (9 states have ratified)

__American Constitution: 7 Articles;__

Nothing on any of the articles that talked about rights in the constitution (Bill of Rights as a separate document)

__1791 Bill of Rights__
Bill of Rights was going to be part of the original constitution (agreed upon) but the Bill of Rights was not ready yet - led to the signing of the Constitution.

Only have had 17 amendments to the bill of rights since the end of 18th Century.

* 25 (27) amendments;
* First 10 passed in early years. Next 15 passed over 250 years.
* (idea is that it is extremely difficult to change the constitution)

* Article 1, section 2 - Legislature.
* Article 2 - Executive (president) - impeachment.
* __Article 5__
    * How to change the constitution:
        * To add (2/3 of both houses)
        * To amend (2/3 of all states' legislature: agreement by 3/4 of all states.)

__Argument if it's good:__
Removal of power from the Executive - aligned with the interests of the anti-monarchy and the ideals of democracy upheld by the Founding Fathers.

####10 Amendments to Constituiton:

* 1 Am. free speech, assembly, press and practice of religion.
* 2 Am. bear arms.
* 4 Am. unreasonable searches
* 5 Am. self-incrimination (legal oath - Miranda rights -you have the right to remain silent. 1960s)
* 6 Am. fair trials (speedy and public) - guantanamo bay
* 8 Am. cruel and unusual punishment cannot be imposed - extended to you cannot suffer.
* __9 Am.__ Any right that is not named (enumerated) on Constitution or Bill of Rights still belongs to the people.
* __10 Am.__ Any power that is not given to the federal govt belong to the 13 states and the people.

### Idea of Republican Government
(debates between 2 POV basis)

* Economic Basis
    * Minimal role for government. Pursuit of selfish economic interest will lead to common good. Autonomy, independence and freedom from authoritarian regime.
* Political Basis
    * Individuals have to sacrifice for the common good. (We the People)
    * Central government collects the contributions and distributes it. (Stronger power on national/federal government)
