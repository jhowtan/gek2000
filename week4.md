#Week 4

###Tutorial 2

_In 1776, Thomas Jefferson stated in the Declaration of Independence that man had rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In what ways did the experiences of women and non-whites, eg blacks and Native Americans, betray the ideals which Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers championed?_

**Ideals:** Unalienable Rights given to **men**.

**Men:** used consistently throughout the declaration of independence.
Implicitly not inclusive of women(?)

**Men (male) vs Man (humanity):**

Declaration of Independence: Contending to who should be put in government (domain of politics).

**significance of capitalized Men: domain of politics belongs to (male) men**.

Not only looking at Gender but also Race (no blacks)

**Betray** (crux of the question): going against some prior agreement - agreed upon (x issue) - set the expectations on the two parties.

**BUT** need to note the larger context in which the DOI was written - 13 colonies were not being represented; still subsumed under the King, hardship through life in the colonies (needs not taken care of)

---

## Women: 

1) Yes, they were betrayed

* Some women could express themselves (especially during the War) - increasing participation of women in the war: provide war supplies (visibility of women in the war)
* Made use of newfound visibility to ask for concessions (Abigail Adams) - if men could pay more attention to the women's association (pursuit of life liberty and property is given)
* Despite above these: most of the women are still excluded from functions of society (not much progress in social status of women in political, economic or social realm)

2) No, they were not betrayed

__Position of the Men:__

* Founding Fathers were not saints - everyday men who had a lot of glaring flaws (out of first 5 presidents, 4 owned slaves)
* Men was referred to in the literal sense of gender - contextualize to the mentality of the Founding Fathers
* FF ideals were about what they knew up to that part of their lives (first generation immigrants)

__Position of the Women:__

* Women went to the war because they had no choice but to follow their husbands.
* Had no financial independence - livelihood was going to the warfront.
* Abigail Adams' voice: seek to reenforce the position of women (roles) in society (already traditionally doing).
* Increasing visibility in the sphere that was already created to be housed by women.
* No expectation = no betrayal.

### Notes

__Conflict between female gender roles__ vs __Ideals of rights to liberty and pursuit of happiness__  
Political partisanship and debate were not of womanly concern.

Voters: "all free inhabitants" meeting property and residence requirements. (vague definition)

No universal suffrage for women and minority races despite rights to liberty.

Discriminatory opposition of woman and black suffrage - in legislation and state constitution.

Male discrimination of women on watching female cast ballots. (New Jersey men never displayed strong commitment to principle of woman suffrage - felt as if it was a mistake/loophole)

Males still had ultimate say on the public political meanings given to specific vocabulary used in legislature - misunderstood by women because of male veto.

Female roles in society gradually shifted towards greater importance but with reservations in predominantly male-run society.

Absence of feminism in the behavior of women during the Revolution and in their attitudes afterward is related to the demographic changes that were taking place within the family unit between 1760 and 1800 - Middle and upper class women were increasingly subjected to foreign and domestic literature stressing standards of femininity that had not inhibited the conduct of their colonial ancestors.

Loss of function and authentic status for all women due to "conscious neglect of female rights combined with subtle educational and economic exploitation"

---

## Non-whites

### Native Americans:

1) Yes, betrayed

* Life, liberty and pursuit of happiness - ancestral land taken away, natives were killed, and the intimate relationship with the land they lived with robbed them of their livelihood. Massive upheaval; 1-for-1 betrayal.

2) Not betrayed

* No expectation = no betrayal
* FF did not know of such people when they first came in, declaration was not expected to include of such peoples.
* LCE showed us how little the american settlers knew of the new continent. (thought of the land as empty)
* Classical world model: Asia, Europe, Africa, America (New World)
* Superior civilization will prescribe inferiority.

### Blacks:

1) Yes, betrayed

* Drafted to fight the British in the Revolutionary War.
* Promise of freedom for being a patriot in the war.
* Yet encountered the prejudice and racism for a very long time.

2) No not betrayed

* Property - not considered humans.

###Notes:

__Despite rights to life and liberty declared:__

* Blacks still seen as property (regardless of status of freedom) - 
"Blacks learned not to look to white society for their liberty, but to seize the moment, whenever and wherever it presented itself, to liberate themselves" - wartime disruption to obtain freedom;
* Post Revolutionary War - slave traders kidnapping of Blacks (unconstitutional to ideals of rights)
* Slavery had not ended with the war.
* Black Americans - had neither liberty nor land - fought for liberty to hope to gain land.
* Native Americans - had both liberty and land - struggled to preserve both.
* Natives "concluded that their revolutionary goals could best be achieved through fighting against the side that proclaimed the equality of all men and with the side that the Americans accused of trampling on their natural, irreducible rights.

---

_“Thomas Jefferson and the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution had no intention of including women, African-Americans or Native Americans in their declaration of inalienable rights of men. Discuss.”_

Conclude that they had no intentions of including women, African-Americans, or Native Americans (Tutorial 2)

BUT did not make any explicit effort to completely exclude them, at least in their formation of the Constitution.

When commenting on history, have to be mindful of the time in which the events were taking place. Given the context and setting of the time, most (if not all) African-Americans in US were slaves: Founding Fathers (4/5) were slaveholders - slaves were property to them (paradigm and mentality of the period).

Native Americans were fighting against the Americans (settlers) during the American Revolution, did not want to see the organization of settlers against them - fighting against patriots meant that Native Americans were enemies of the State and that it wouldn't be natural for the Founding Fathers to be granting their enemies rights.

Women in early America didn't want rights, but instead wanted protection and privileges. The focus was on setting up a system where those who wanted and sought for their rights were able to get them, even if it took a long hard battle.

+ Bonus: Declaration of inalienable rights of men - old document that had to encompass the ideas of liberty, life, and pursuit of happiness (property) held up as a rather good job.

# Westward Expansion and the Shaping of American Society

To understand slavery, it is necessary to go through the early part of the 19th century.

## Readings

###I. 1801 - 1823

__Federalists__: Strong national government to promote economic development; exerted influence via judiciary.

__Democratic-Republicans__: limited government, stayed out of religious affairs, spent little on military -> early partisanship.

__Louisiana purchase:__ Acquisition of Louisiana from the French under Jefferson.

__Corps of Discovery__ to chart Mississippi region's commercial possibilities.

- fostering trade relations, political allies, acquire Indian's knowledge of the lands.

__Economy heavily dependent on international trade.__

- fought to guard its commerce and ships on high seas.
    * war with Barbary states: refusal to pay tribute for safe passage of ships.
    * war of 1812: violation of trading rights, impressment (forced recruitment), attacks on ships (based mainly on the issue of freedom on the seas).
        * inspired American nationalism and development.

#### Treaty of Ghent

* restored pre war status quo, ending war of 1812.
* damaged Indian resistance, accelerating industrial growth.

#### Fate of Federalists

* lost credibility due to opposition to war
* faded from political scene in 1820.
* leading to absence of partisanship -> "Era of Good Feelings"
    * split on America's future route to prosperity.
    * John Marshall & support of Federalist agenda, issuing rulings stimulating commerce & industry
    * Democratic-Republicans looked towards territorial expansion
        * Proclamation of non-tolerance with European intervention
        * Strengthening international presence, threatened political unity domestically.

#### Tensions of 1819

- __"Panic of 1819"__
  - collapse of banking system, high levels of unemployment
  - falling commodity prices, threat of runaway inflation
- **"Missouri Compromise"**
  - political crisis about slavery's westward expansion
  - joining of new states arising from Louisiana purchase
  - joining of Missouri would give shareholding states a two-vote majority - feat that this would allow more western states to be admitted as slave-states.
  - long term consequences, compromise did not resolve political conflict over slavery's westward expansion
  - merely masked the conflict -> long term consequences of dividing the nation


###II. Rise of the South - growth of the South (1815-1860)

- land, wealth and power along with the rest of the country.
- similar historical experiences and political economy but developed differently
    - ideological and economic differences due to slavery.
        - south: biracial with a cultural mix
    - cotton boom, "King Cotton" + indian removal policies
      - growth into a slave society
          - development of a leadership determined to preserve a hierarchical social & racial order
          - split between the whites: democratic yeomen (universal suffrage) vs profit motivated planters
        - development of black folk culture and religion of deliverance
        - blacks often had different fates (bondage vs survival)
    - profitable and expanding salve society arising from slave labour and whites' knowledge
- contrast in the North
  - growth of a different society driven by industrialism, free labour
  - longterm consequences of a divided society
  - agricultural south vs industrial north --> arising from climate (asymmetrical development of infrastructure)

###III. The restless north (1815 -1860)

__Embrace of commercial culture__

- Northen states and capitalists investing in internal improvements
- shift towards commercial farming, industrial wage labour

__Introduction/shift to market economy__

* Progress
    * cheap Western lands
    * employment for surplus farm labrourers
    * commercial availability of goods
    * development of transportation infrastructure
    * distant regions > accessible
* Costs
  * increased specialization
  * Depersonalised workplace
  * sharp divide between work & leisure
  * more affected to global economic shocks

__Social changes__

- smaller families arising from less need for children's labour
- influx of immigrants
- lowest paying work
- blamed for problems caused by economic growth, victims of anti-immigrant/anti-blacks riots (responded by forming own communities)

__Cities as the symbol of economic growth__

- extreme wealth & working class cultures together with poverty & crime
- free-labour ideology to reconcile stark difference = upward mobility in competitive marketplace.
    - becomes increasingly central to northern regional identity.

---

## Terms

* __Northwest Ordinance 1787 – slavery__

Constitution was being debated at this period, early republic deemed this issue important enough to pass some kind of law to deal with what happened when the US Settlers moving westwards - status of the western states.

As settlers moved westwards, territories will be admitted to the united states on the equal status as the original 13 states. Decision was made to create more states.

Newly settled colonies will be treated as states of equal status - eventually these people will have a say in the united states - help to decide on the issue of slavery.

In the newly settled territories so far, there should not be slavery (on the books) - people in the North were against slavery - originally agreed on. Number of settlers were very few, not enough people to form the instruments of government (to form a state).

5,000 - territorial status;
60,000 - statehood.

* __1803 Louisiana Purchase__

$15m for one third of continental US: cheapest purchase in modern real estate history.

Took place under the presidency of Thomas Jefferson.

After 7 years war: Louisiana belonged to Spain; France managed to get spain to transfer the land back to France. US managed to get a third of the US continent (westward) from Napoleon.

Alaska purchase of the Russians. (another notable purchase)

* __1804-6 Lewis & Clark Expedition__ (important)

Thought they would find a river system similar to the Great Mississippi River system (very important) on the western frontier; Woolly Mammoth, Salt Mountains. (white settlers knew very little of the new world)

Agricultural produce for export was transported down the Mississippi River to the port of New Orleans (no railroads or proper road systems back then)

* __Missouri Compromise, 1820__ – 36° 30’
    * Northern state that belonged to the South
* Constitutional
    * what was deemed aligned or compliant to the Constitution
* States’ Right
* __Monroe Doctrine 1823__ – non-colonisation of Western Hemisphere

* __Manifest Destiny 1845__ (important)

Settlers have all reached California - John Sullivan popularized the term;

God has given rights to settle the land westwards of the Mississippi River. Gave the US Settlers an excuse to colonize the land of the natives.

* __Frontier Theory – Turner 1893 - 1890 census__ (important)

Also known as the Turner thesis. Westward movement created a series of frontiers. Frontier is the point of contact between the settlers and the natives. Moved slowly in a series of movements - the border of the US was a moving line.

Once the Americans have reached the pacific ocean - the process of the frontier has come to an end. Spirit of the frontier still lived on in Americans - which created the America that it is today.

America only takes a census every ten years (0th year). Spot census - anybody can be called. 1890 census decided that there is no more new territory to be explored.

"Quintessential american character" - different from anybody else in the world (Romanticization of a process)

Historical debate: What Jackson Turner said is accurate (positive traits) vs negative traits that also happened that became part of the American character.

## Observations

* 19th century US before Civil War (1861-65) - intersection of western expansion & the issue of slavery (space & race)
* This lecture (week 4) – westward expansion & consequences
* Next lecture (week 5) – slavery & its consequence

    __Asking on Turner's thesis:__  
    Why & how did the expansion to the Pacific Ocean shape American society in the 19th C?

    Why was expansion Westward seen as an antidote to urbanization & industrialisation?

## Period from 1800-1860

* 1st W of Appalachian settlement 1771
* 1800 – settlers in Mississippi & Ohio river valleys
* By 1860s, US was a continental power – from Atlantic to Pacific – size, power & wealth
    * Very few continental powers in the world in the 19th century.
    * Only Russia and US (2 ocean continental power)
* Size of the population + wealth that is inherent.
* Westward expansion was parallel - important factor on Slavery.

## The International Scene

* The French Revolution & Napoleonic Wars (1789-1815)

Important event because it affects how the Americans see themselves.

* The Louisiana Purchase (1803) - $15 million
* Florida ceded by Spain (1819) - $5m
* Monroe Doctrine (1823)

By 1823, US has already become quite an important power in N America. Most of the European powers are setting their eyes back on the New World.

American government decided they don't want anymore European colonization of the New World.

Got concerned and put out a Declaration (James Monroe) - unilateral declaration
"We don't think that Europeans should colonize any more land in the New World"

__"New world should not be subject to new European colonies"__

US does not have a strong military might - _no ability to enforce the doctrine but what they said had a presence._

Kennedy invoked the Monroe doctrine on the Russians (Cuban Missile Crisis) - US had a military power by then

---

## Precedents in the New Republic

Precedents - _model that people refer to as a principle_

* Washington & his Farewell Address – 1796 – no *entangling* military alliance – unilateral foreign policy declaration

Washington established that nobody should serve in the White House for more than 2 terms. **important to consider with respect to the rest of the world where despots and dictators were around**

(Implications were had for the establishment of Democracy in America)

__Entangling__ - refers to what Washington said (farewell message to the people when he left presidency in 1796):

    It is not advisable for US to take sides in foreign wars.
    Do not want entangling alliances with other countries.

* **Presidential prerogative** – Louisiana Purchase

__It is not in the constitution for the executive to purchase land.__ Jefferson claimed executive prerogative (_"I have to do it even though it is not in the constitution"_)

* The Supreme Court & Constitutionality – theory of judicial review of legislation & presidential acts
    * what is constitutional?

Purchase of Louisiana was not constitutional (according to constitutional scholars) but it was so popular back in the day it was deemed constitutional.

* __Debate over states’ rights__ – the issue of slavery

Linked to Northwest Ordinance.  
Whether new states have the right to make slavery legal within new territory.

* __Debate over role of government in people’s life__
    * Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations: rational self-interest & common good
    * Idea of minimum/small/limited govt
    * Individualism

Centred on the issue of slavery back in the 19th C.

---

## Westward Expansion

### 2 major evolutions

1. The structure of society, politics, democracy & the  economy
2. The issue of slavery

###I.  Foreign influences

1.  __Free Security?__ From 1823 – threat from Europe lessened

Important formative years of the US were unhindered by the European powers due to Napoleonic wars; Gave US the freedom to develop.

2.  __Impact of 1789-1815 European conflicts__ – beginning of manufactures

US were inhibited from the ability to import European manufactures (industrial goods) due to the Napoleonic wars.
Industrialisation of the US began due to the need for manufactures.

3.  __No more serious ‘Indian’ threat__

Native American tribes can't play the powers against each other anymore with the removal of European powers.

###II. The removal of Indians from ancestral land in the East

* Shawnees from Ohio to Indiana to Missouri to Kansas and Texas (1795-1830s)

Occupied land that settlers wanted - led to native occupation of less fertile land.

* Cherokees from Georgia to Oklahoma –1830s – Trail of Tears – federal troops - 1838-9 – ¼ of 20,000 died

###III.  Removal to less fertile land

* Competition with existing tribes
* Decline of culture
* Dependence on govt handouts

Repercussions: More native americans have higher unemployment rates, all kinds of negative effects than any racial group.

* 100m acres east of Mississippi river for 32m acres west of river

Many historians acknowledged that this was a colonization (displaced Indian tribes and culture) - internal empire.

* The great American colonial empire?

###IV.  Population increase

* mass movements inland & westward – (the American character on the frontier)

__Turner Thesis:__ Progressive Westward movement - don't have settled societies, no law enforcement / government. Look after themselves - survive.
Self-reliant, enterprising, democratic.

The violence in American society today is attributed to the Frontier experience.

* large immigrant population (land of opportunity)

Land of 2nd and 3rd chances - optimistic society - ability to reinvent themselves (even today)

* creation of local churches in new territories
    * 2nd Great Awakening 1800-1840s – revival
  * Spiritual Autonomy - no clergymen nor pastorial ministry - religion is democratized
      * emotional experience of God rather than bible knowledge
      * democratization of religion
      * greater female participation -fragmentation

* Minimal govt control  & economic intervention
    * distance & difficulty in communicating
    * frontier justice (sheriffs) & violence?
    * (from Territory to State)

###V.  Technology – industry & land
1. Transportation
    * development of waterways, roads & from 1830s, rail – goods & people – rail after 1850s developing regional & national links
    * railroad schedule established the time zone agreements between towns/cities, links the national economy.
    * railroad system created new cities - opposed to linking existing cities (as in Europe)
2. Development of machine-tool manufacture
    * non-agricultural & mass production
    * stimulated by embargo caused partly by European conflicts

###VI.  Impact of manufacturing & specialisation

__Market Economy, Wage and Payments__

1. Not just an agrarian economy
2. From cottage production to mass production – textiles – New England
3. Consumer as well as producer economies – ready made clothing after 1820s
4. Immigration of industrial & agricultural workers – cities become diverse & complex – development of multicultural societies; Gender roles & divisions– payment & rights – women workers
    * Women able to earn wages working outside the home in manufacturing industries -> gender relations - beginning of specialization.
5.  Growth in numbers & size of large cities
6.  Increasing use of machines meant decline of artisan skills – workers instead of craftsmen (specialization)
7.  __Rhythm of life dominated by factory schedule__

###VII.  Income differentials

* gap between very rich and poor
* growing middle class – different patterns of consumption, education, etc

###VIII.  Specialisation and Regionalisation

* NE, industry and finance, - development of banks & credit system
* South – plantation economies,
* Mid-West and West, agriculture etc

###IX.  Growing differences between slave and non-slave states

North (urban, non-slave) vs South (rural, slave)

* slave states, less diversified – __dependent on ‘King Cotton’__
* __1808 – slave import ended (slavery was gradually made illegal by the north)__
* Internal movement of slaves from old South into new slave states, - Missouri, Alabama & Texas
* Argument over States’ Rights
* __1820 Missouri Compromise: 36° 30’ (line) – no subsequent state can be admitted as a slave state north of that (not successful)__
* Issue merely postponed
* Racialism continued to define Southern society (Hierarchical & Paternalistic)
* Division of Southern society into 3 segments – slaveholder (elites), non-slaveholder (white but poor), slave
    * elevates the poor whites (not at the bottom due to slaves)
* Expansion West had adverse impact on blacks – __slave families separated (union was not legally recognized)__
