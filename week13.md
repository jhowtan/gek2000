# Week 13

# After WWII

Superpower: vast stockpiles of atomic weapons; ability to project power beyond own territories, waters, region. Hard and soft power. Strong naval fleet supplemented by aircraft carriers and bases in friendly countries.

* Cold war
* Bipolar world / bipolarity
    - different social and cultural norms
    - different  methods of organising economy
    - potential not only for military conflict; but also an ideological conflict
* Ideological conflict / contest
* Balance of terror
    - arising from military capabilities
* Arguments for when the Cold War started:
    - 'Iron Curtain' 1946, Churchill
    - 'Truman Doctrine' 1947
    - Marshall Plan 1948
    - Formation of NATO 1949
* Domino Theory
    - Perception that any country falling to communism will cause others around it to fall to communism
        + Empirically incorrect (didn't happen throughout history)
        + Disregards variety of domestic systems and cultures of different Asian states
        + heavily influenced American politicans and policy makers
* War by proxy or client states (Proxy warfare)
* 1954 Geneva Accords
* JFK
* Limited war
* By 1960s, not possible to fight conventional warfare to fight communist forces in every country. US should learn to fight unconventional wars (wars against communist insurgents/rebels)
    - Special forces / Green Beret
    - Counter-insurgencies against wars of national liberation and/or guerilla wars
    - Training American soldiers in guerilla warfare to wage unconventional warefare against communists in foreign countries
* LBJ
* Vietnam War, quagmire (20 years)

## Observations

* Why does the world greatest power feel insecure?
    - The need for enemy?
    - No respite from WWII? *always involved in wars, military spending was never cut down on*
* Radical change after 1945
    - Perception of ideological conflict with communism/Soviet Union
    - Active foreign policy engagement on global scale
        + Not conservative or reactive, acts beyond its natural territorial waters
        + Compared to post WWI, cf. League of Nations, UN, neutrality
    - Series of military alliances & bases in world e.g. NATO etc
    - Involvement in regional/local wars
    - Others' perception (overemphasis) that the ‘enemy of my enemy is my friend’ - on US foreign policy
    - Either ‘with us or against us’
    - Alliances or identification with unsavory or undemocratic dictators
        + Conundrum: If US is on the side of Democracy, why are so many of your allies non-democratic (yet professes to be fighting for democracy and capitalism)
    - Strong anti-American sentiments spread outside of Western Hemisphere
        + most of the anti-American sentiment is caused by US military action/involvement in X region.

## After 1945

* Uneasy wartime alliance with Soviet Union falls apart – **mutual suspicion**
    - **US**: Perception of Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe – eastern front & help to pro-communist regimes
    - **Soviet**: perception of American hostility to fall of Eastern Europe to communism
    - After 1917 Russian revolution, US disliked the Communist Regime so much they withheld the full diplomatic recognition of USSR (no official relations with the country) up until FDR.
    - 1941 wartime alliance based on convenience and necessity unable to resolve the years of tension.
    - When the war ended, they went back to how they felt about each others' economic, political, and military systems.
    - One of the things that hardened the US suspicions of Russia, Eastern European countries turned Communist with the aid of Soviet regime.
* Truman Doctrine, 1947:
    - Little foreign policy experience, more of a domestic leader
    - Kept most of FDR's foreign policy advisors
    - Most decisions that were made were not just Truman's decisions, but made with the advice of Roosevelt's officials
    - Marked the beginning of the anti-Soviet sentiment (Cold War)
    - that US should support people everywhere against Communist threat – global commitment
        + 'Everywhere' does not apply outside of Eastern and Western Europe at the time (containment) - until Fall of China to communism and the beginning of the Korean war (1950s)
    - 'Help support' was phrased as "containment of Communism" initially in Europe – against perceived threat of Soviet global expansion
        + Keep the situation as it is, but will not let it get worse
    - Series of US measures taken against communism:
        + military alliances, economic aid, nuclear arms race, & CIA undercover subversion (assassination)
* Containment
    - Containment is not about sending troops in to interfere and restore prior regimes.
    - Historians: Organizing principle of US Foreign Policy against the further spread of Communism
        + Consensus in foreign policy during Cold War – organising principle, 1946 – ideological foreign policy
        + foreign policy of the United States after World War II that aimed to prevent the spread of Communism & oppose Communist nations by diplomatic or military means.
    - Fear of Terror (use of Nuclear Weapons), except for the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Berlin Wall Crisis (where relations got hot enough to break into full US-Soviet war)
    - No direct military confrontation between US & USSR, except Cuba, 1962
    - Use of proxy/client states, e.g. Cuba, Korea, Vietnam  – limited war
    - Legacy of WWII & the fight against Nazism – fear of appeasement
    - No military ‘roll-back’ or liberation of communism seriously anticipated even in Eastern Europe
    - 2 foundational documents (on how to help US operationalize Containment):
        + Long Telegram, 1946, “Sources of Soviet Conduct” - George Kennan
        + NSC-68 – militarized Containment and Cold War – peacetime military buildup & spending (**globalized ccontainment**)
            * Truman: If we are containing Communism in Europe, what are we going to do with Communism in Asia?
            * China, North Korea, North Vietnam
            * Provided for the tripling of the US military budget which allowed US to set up bases globally

## Cold War in Asia

* Late 1940s & early 1950s extension of containment to Asia (NSC-68)
* Decolonization: **Fight against communism entangled with fight of former colonies for independence against former West European colonial masters**, (UK, France, Holland) allies of the US
* WWII set in place the sentiment that in a post-war world, did not want to see colonialism (by Roosevelt - Atlantic Charter); internally, nationalist movements in Asia: China, Vietnam, India, Indonesia.
* Twin Process: Decolonization + Containment
    - None of us have ever lived in a world where the US was not the dominant voice - our countries were born in the period that were a consequence of the twin processes
    - What would it be like once US is not the dominant power (no countries stay dominant forever)
    - Small countries would have to adjust and transit to a regional struggle for the seat of the dominant power
* American misconception that communists cannot be nationalists; irony that US 1st revolutionary state (Late 40s, Early 50s: Communists and Nationalists are mutually exclusive)
    - e.g. Ho Chi Minh, Mao.

## Fall of China to Communism
* 1949: Mao wins control of China; Chiang Kaishek flees to Formosa (Taiwan)
* US has always felt that they have a very special relationship with China
    - A lot of aid was sent to the KMT but was not used against CCP.
    - US political system tried to assign blame on what US policy was responsible for the Fall of China to Communism **(Witch hunt)**
    - Observation: Fall of China was more a result of the forces internally in China rather than what happened politically in US (presumptuous)
    - US Sentiments: Domestic repercussions in US – Senator Joe McCarthy (Republican) & accusations of ‘Who lost China”? – against Democrats (5 terms in office, Republicans wanted to get back into Office)
    - Democrats began trying to justify their stand against the Republicans; fear of appearing weak & appeasing communism
    - Violation of civil rights of ‘communist sympathisers’

## Korean War
* To make things even worse: 1950 - Beginning of Korean War
    - civil war in which the US & Soviet Union took sides
        + Geopolitical war (politics because of geography, int'l scale - between nations that are neighbors)
    - Chinese forces (close to a million sent to N Korea) - 1953
    - Armistice/truce – 38th Parallel: permanent Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) (trip-wire - if N Korea wants to restart the war, N Koreans just have to cross the 38th) - US troops still stationed now – ‘trip-wire’
    - No peace treaty, war never ended
* Not the Fall of China to Communism that led to US involvement in Asia but the Korean War, led to a series of treaties signed with Asian countries:
    - 1951 – Mutual Security Treaty with Japan – bases
    - 1954, Sept – Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, SEATO – US-led, only 2 SEAsian states
    - 1955 – Formosa Resolution – American forces in Taiwan

## Vietnam War
* Vietnam – Ho Chi Minh – communist leader –
* Nationalist credentials during WWII - against Japanese – Vietminh guerrillas
* Terms of Japanese surrender in 1945
* French return resisted until 1954 – Fall of Dienbienphu
    - Last pitch battle, if French lost Dienbienphu, they would lose Vietnam
    - De Gaux turned to British and Americans for help (Churchill: British problems, no. Ike: Generals consulted - no. "Bomb them back to the Stone Age")
    - HCM won the battle of Dienbienphu
* Geneva Accords –
* 17th Parallel – temporary division between Communist N Vietnam & non-communist S Vietnam
    - HCM had control over North of the 17th
    - French returned to re-assume power in the South
* American & South Vietnamese violation of election promise – Ike’s view
    - refused to hold the election because HCM would have won Vietnam, South wanted reunification with the North
* America did not want to accept a Vietnam that is unified under HCM (Communist)
    - S Vietnam - Installation of Ngo Dinh Diem (nationalist who was a political refugee in the US) in mid 1950s
    - Corrupt & ineffective, without American help, Ngo Dinh Diem would lose S Vietnam
    - Surreptitious American aid: American officers training the S Vietnamese army - ‘advisers’ – counter-insurgency
    - Nov 1963 (less than 10 years) – assassination of Diem – beginning of more direct involvement – series of military regimes installed by US - instability in Vietnam

### Tonkin Gulf Resolution
* LBJ took over JFK after his assassination, engineered confrontations with NV.
* 2 reported episodes of naval confrontation between US & NV – 1 actual, one fabricated? (2 Aug 1964)
* **7 Aug, 1964 - authorized LBJ to “take all necessary measures to repel armed attack against the forces of the US & prevent further aggression”**
* LBJ – Resolution – “like grandma’s nightshirt – it covered everything” – no declaration of war necessary? Gave permission to LBJ to do anything with regards to sending troops to Vietnam
* Did not want to go to War because 1964 was the elections, re-elected in Nov 1964.
* Misled – open-ended concession – repealed in 1970
* 1965 – initiation of bombing ‘Rolling Thunder’ – *use of land forces followed; gradual escalation from a limited war*
    - planned with the use of airpower
    - NV guerillas would sabotage airbases
    - marines were sent in to protect the airbases (beginning the slippery slope), and more troops were sent in to Vietnam
* 1968 – ineffective South Vietnamese military leaders – when Kennedy died (few thousand troops; LBJ 1968: over half a million American troops – ‘mission creep’
* no declaration of war – ‘credibility gap’ & assurances of victory & ‘light at the end of the tunnel’

###LBJ
* inability to tolerate dissent
* Misleading optimism
* Domestic opposition
* International criticism – tactic of bombing (shouldn't be using bombs on innocent farmers in NV)

###Tet Offensive (Lunar New Year 1968)
* Weeks of planning to bring all the equipment to the cities, nature of the war had changed completely, organized a simultaneous uprising in the SV cities.
* military uprising by North Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam cities – previously only guerrilla warfare in the countryside
* attack on important military & psychological targets, e.g. occupation of US embassy in Saigon (US territory)

### End of Vietnam War
* Domestic opposition grew – recognition by LBJ administration that war not winnable at price acceptable to:
    - majority of American people AND
    - international public opinion
    - Therefore beginning of the end – not open-ended commitment
* 1968 – Nixon elected; Nixon Doctrine: help others to help themselves
    - ‘Vietnamisation’ of war – S Vietnamese troops to do the fighting & dying
    - Half million American troops gradually withdrawn
* From 1969 – US negotiates to withdraw
* 1973 – Paris Cease-fire Agreement
* 1973 – War Powers Act
    - get congress/legislative permission to go to war
* 1975 fall of Saigon – renamed Ho Chi Minh city

### The Divisive War
* Divisive war – undermined foreign policy consensus of containment in Asia – ‘pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend….” idea of Kennedy questioned?
    - Should the US do that with Allies that are not capable of fighting their own battles?
    - Cold War started in Europe, but yet the 2 hottest battles were fought in Asia
    - NATO was never used against the Soviet Union
* 2 major ‘proxy’ wars of Cold War, Korea & Vietnam in Asia – irony?
* 8 presidents & Vietnam (from Roosevelt)

### Justification for war
* Containment and Domino Theory
* If we don't keep our word to Vietnam, allies elsewhere will question the value of commitment (faith issue)
* Domestic Politics - fear of 'Who lost Vietnam?' (similar to Fall of China)

### Lessons of Vietnam

Vietnam - America’s longest war – resources & manpower – 10,000 days? - questioning of nature of American involvement – ‘Vietnam syndrome’ – loss of confidence

1.  Whether the US had the right to intervene
2.  whether the US pursued the right policy when it intervene – military & otherwise – overwhelming application of superior technology against weak nation – ‘bombed back to the stone age’
3.  Whether techniques used, e.g. backing of repressive regimes, bombing, etc was consistent with American democracy
4.  whether the US had ‘exit strategy’
5.  Validity of Domino Theory in Asian context – from mid-1950s

**Where to intervene**
* US should differentiate between crucial & peripheral regions in deciding when to intervene
* US should only intervene in nations where the domestic govt is willing & able to fight

**Military implications**

American military should only fight when there are defined political goals & willingness to use overwhelming force to achieve desired outcome – clear ‘exit strategy’, **Powell doctrine**

**Imperial Presidency & domestic support**

- Refers to Tonkin Gulf Resolution
- the US cannot fight sustained war unless the President has Congress & people behind him

### Consequences
* Loss of American confidence & inclination to commit troops & incur casualties overseas
* Self-examination by American people
* Loss of American prestige & moral authority overseas – question of judgment
* Domestic implications for American politics & politicians – still dealing with ‘Vietnam syndrome’
    - Every President had to deal with questions of Vietnam up till Obama
* ‘Bought time’ theory?
    - Kissinger, LKY
    - Because US fought that war, gave SE Asia time and confidence to develop their economy etc.
* First television war – access & coverage – censorship & cover-up

## End of Cold War

The fracturing of the cold war consensus of containment – gives way to strategic uncertainty - What takes its place?
New forms of conflict – e.g. terrorism – non-ideological
Should the US turn inwards or continue to engage?
If the US continues to engage, should it act as a unilateral power or embrace multi-lateralism? The UN or others?

Does the US adopt a less expansive foreign policy – no more ‘world policeman’ or ‘world bully’ – indications in recent events?? – intervene only when vital interests at stake but
Who defines ‘vital interests’?
Fear of Asia-Pacific nations that US no longer actively engaged in this region – China factor
Will unification of Korea be a signal? - De-stabilization of N Asia?

Has optimism of 1989-1991 & the hope of the ‘peace dividend’ given way to different anxieties & fears? 
War on Terror since 2001 (the way they responded to the Cold War)
Still world’s only superpower 
‘Lessons’ of the past 
Difference between WWI, WWII AND Cold War – no serious attempt to dismantle ‘big military’

## Soft Power & Clout

Powers of attraction, not coercion
Values and influence
Others have exercised it in the past but,
Modern technology, films, advertising, & TV make this even more intrusive & pervasive??
Linked with fears of ‘globalization’ & 
Disappearance of local culture
Are the words ‘modernization’ & ‘Westernization/Americanization’ now synonymous?

The ‘Coca-colonization’ or ‘McDonaldisation’ of the world?
The protection of own cultural traditions in Europe & Asia
Young, primary consumers – a lost generation?
Self-enrolled
BUT - Military & economic & cultural power interlinked – therefore SMART Power??

### Economic Clout

During Cold War years, access to market, investment, technology & organizational expertise, - what about after 1991? – access to US market & investment still crucial – economic downtowns of 1997 & 2001 etc – WTO, IMF & World Bank
2008 financial melt-down – role of US as global engine of growth??
